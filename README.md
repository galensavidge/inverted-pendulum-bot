# Inverted Pendulum Bot

The goal of this project is to develop feedback techniques to control a two-wheeled inverted pendulum robot, design and build an inverted pendulum robot from scratch, and test feedback control on the physical design. The robot will be constructed out of laser cut acrylic pieces and off the shelf components. The final robot design will hopefully cost $100 or less.
